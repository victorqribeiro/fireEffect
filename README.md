## About

Did you ever asked someone out and later found out that they were laughing about that with their friends? Did you ever got reject after a code interview where you had to implement a whole system over a period of a week, with no feedback on what you got wrong whatsoever? Did you ever shared a project online and people start picking on the smallests things just to piss you off? Well my friend, this is the tool for you. Send a special creative "thank you" note lit on fire and be happy. 

## How to use

You can also pass a strength parameter to control the fire effect:
